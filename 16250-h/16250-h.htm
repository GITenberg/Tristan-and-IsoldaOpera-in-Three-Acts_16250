<h4>THE STORY OF "TRISTAN AND ISOLDA"</h4>
<p class="center">ACT I</p>
<p>Tristan, a valiant Cornish knight, is bringing Isolda, princess
of Ireland, over as a bride for his uncle, King Mark. He is himself
in love with her, but owing to a blood feud between them, forces
himself to conceal his passion. Isolda, in anger at his seeming
unkindness, attempts to poison herself and him, but her attendant,
Brang&aelig;na, changes the draft for a love potion, which enflames
their passion beyond power of restraint.</p>
<p class="center">ACT II</p>
<p>Isolda has been wedded to King Mark, but holds stolen interviews
with Tristan, during one of which they are surprised, for Tristan
has been betrayed by a jealous friend, Melot. Touched by King
Mark's bitter reproaches, Tristan provokes Melot to fight and
suffers himself to be mortally wounded.</p>
<p class="center">ACT III</p>
<p>Tristan's faithful servant, Kurvenal, has carried his wounded
master to his native home in Brittany, where he is carefully
tended. Isolda has also been sent for, as being skilled above all
others in the healing art. The excitement of her approach only
hastens Tristan's death, and he breathes his last sigh in her arms.
Mark has followed Isolda; he has had matters explained, and is
prepared to reunite the lovers, but it is too late. Isolda utters
her lament over the body of her lover, and her heart breaks: in
death alone are they united.</p>

<h2>TRISTAN AND ISOLDA.</h2>
<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p>[<i>A pavilion erected on the deck of a ship, richly hung with
tapestry, quite closed in at back at first. A narrow hatchway at
one side leads below into the cabin</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p>ISOLDA <i>on a couch, her face buried in the cushions.&mdash;
</i>BRANG&AElig;NA <i>holding open a curtain, looks over the side
of the vessel</i>.</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF A YOUNG SAILOR (<i>from above as if at the
mast-head</i>).</p>
<div class="center">
<a href="images/music0007.png"><img src="images/music0007_t.png" alt=

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>starting up suddenly</i>).<br />
What wight dares insult me?</p>
<p>(<i>She looks round in agitation</i>.)</p>
<p>Brang&aelig;na, ho!<br />
Say, where sail we?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>at the opening</i>).<br />
Bluish stripes<br />
are stretching along the west:<br />
swiftly sails<br />
the ship to shore;<br />
if restful the sea by eve<br />
we shall readily set foot on land.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. What land?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Cornwall's verdant strand.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Never more!<br />
To-day nor to-morrow!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. What mean you, mistress? say!</p>
<p>(<i>She lets the curtain fall and hastens to</i> ISOLDA.)</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>with wild gaze</i>).<br />
O fainthearted child,<br />
false to thy fathers!<br />
Ah, where, mother,<br />
hast given thy might<br />
that commands the wave and the tempest?<br />
O subtle art<br />
of sorcery,<br />
for mere leech-craft followed too long!<br />
Awake in me once more,<br />
power of will!<br />
Arise from thy hiding<br />
within my breast!<br />
Hark to my bidding,<br />
fluttering breezes!<br />
Arise and storm<br />
in boisterous strife!<br />
With furious rage<br />
and hurricane's hurdle<br />
waken the sea<br />
from slumbering calm;<br />
rouse up the deep<br />
to its devilish deeds!<br />
Shew it the prey<br />
which gladly I proffer!<br />
Let it shatter this too daring ship<br />
and enshrine in ocean each shred!<br />
And woe to the lives!<br />
Their wavering death-sighs<br />
I leave to ye, winds, as your lot.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>in extreme alarm and concern for</i>
ISOLDA).<br />
Out, alas!<br />
Ah, woe!<br />
I've ever dreaded some ill!&mdash;<br />
Isolda! mistress!<br />
Heart of mine!<br />
What secret dost thou hide?<br />
Without a tear<br />
thou'st quitted thy father and mother,<br />
and scarce a word<br />
of farewell to friends thou gavest;<br />
leaving home thou stood'st,<br />
how cold and still!<br />
pale and speechless<br />
on the way,<br />
food rejecting,<br />
reft of sleep,<br />
stern and wretched,<br />
wild, disturbed;<br />
how it pains me<br />
so to see thee!<br />
Friends no more we seem,<br />
being thus estranged.<br />
Make me partner<br />
in thy pain!<br />
Tell me freely<br />
all thy fears!<br />
Lady, thou hearest,<br />
sweetest and dearest;<br />
if for true friend you take me,<br />
your confidant O make me!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Air! air!<br />
or my heart will choke!<br />
Open! open there wide!</p>
<p>(BRANG&AElig;NA <i>hastily draws the centre curtains
apart</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p>[<i>The whole length of the ship is now seen, down to the stern,
with the sea and horizon beyond. Round the mainmast sailors are
ensconced, busied with ropes; beyond them in the stern are groups
of knights and attendants, also seated; a little apart stands</i>
TRISTAN <i>folding his arms and thoughtfully gazing out to sea; at
his feet</i> KURVENAL <i>reclines carelessly. From the mast-head
above is once more heard the voice of the young sailor</i>.]</p>
<p>THE YOUNG SAILOR (<i>at the mast-head invisible</i>).<br />
The wind so wild<br />
blows homewards now;<br />
my Irish child,<br />
where waitest thou?<br />
Say, must our sails be weighted,<br />
filled by thy sighs unbated?<br />
Waft us, wind strong and wild!<br />
Woe, ah woe for my child!</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>whose eyes have at once sought</i> TRISTAN <i>and
fixed<br />
stonily on him&mdash;gloomily</i>). Once beloved&mdash;<br />
now removed&mdash;<br />
brave and bright,<br />
coward knight!&mdash;<br />
Death-devoted head!<br />
Death-devoted heart!&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>laughing unnaturally</i>).</p>
<p>Think'st highly of yon minion?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>following her glance</i>).<br />
Whom mean'st thou?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. There, that hero<br />
who from mine eyes<br />
averts his own:<br />
in shrinking shame<br />
my gaze he shuns&mdash;<br />
Say, how hold you him?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Mean you Sir Tristan,<br />
lady mine?<br />
Extolled by ev'ry nation,<br />
his happy country's pride,<br />
The hero of creation,&mdash;<br />
whose fame so high and wide?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>jeeringly</i>).<br />
In shrinking trepidation<br />
his shame he seeks to hide,<br />
While to the king, his relation,<br />
he brings the corpse-like bride!&mdash;<br />
Seems it so senseless<br />
What I say?<br />
Go ask himself,<br />
our gracious host,<br />
dare he approach my side?<br />
No courteous heed<br />
or loyal care<br />
this hero t'wards<br />
his lady turns;<br />
but to meet her his heart is daunted,<br />
this knight so highly vaunted!<br />
Oh! he wots<br />
well the cause!<br />
To the traitor go,<br />
bearing his lady's will!<br />
As my servant bound,<br />
straightway should he approach.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Shall I beseech him<br />
to attend thee?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Nay, order him:<br />
pray, understand it:&mdash;<br />
I, Isolda<br />
do command it!</p>
<p>[<i>At an imperious sign from ISOLDA BRANG&AElig;NA withdraws
and timidly walks along the deck towards the stern, past the
working sailors. ISOLDA, following her with fixed gaze, sinks back
on the couch, where she remains seated during the following, her
eyes still turned sternward</i>.]</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>observing Brang&aelig;na's approach, plucks Tristan
by the robe without rising</i>.) Beware, Tristan!<br />
Message from Isolda!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>starting</i>). What is't?&mdash;Isolda?&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>He quickly regains his composure as BRANG&AElig;NA
approaches and curtsies to him</i>.)</p>
<p>What would my lady?<br />
I her liegeman,<br />
fain will listen<br />
while her loyal<br />
woman tells her will.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. My lord, Sir Tristan,<br />
Dame Isolda<br />
would have speech<br />
with you at once.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Is she with travel worn?<br />
The end is near:<br />
nay, ere the set of sun<br />
sight we the land.<br />
All that your mistress commands me,<br />
trust me, I shall mind.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. That you, Sir Tristan,<br />
go to her,--<br />
this is my lady's wish.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Where yonder verdant meadows<br />
in distance dim are mounting,<br />
waits my sov'reign<br />
for his mate:<br />
to lead her to his presence<br />
I'll wait upon the princess:<br />
'tis an honor<br />
all my own.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. My lord, Sir Tristan,<br />
list to me:<br />
this one thing<br />
my lady wills,<br />
that thou at once attend her,<br />
there where she waits for thee.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. In any station<br />
where I stand<br />
I truly serve but her,<br />
the pearl of womanhood.<br />
If I unheeding<br />
left the helm,<br />
how might I pilot her ship<br />
in surety to King Mark?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Tristan, my master,<br />
why mock me thus?<br />
Seemeth my saying<br />
obscure to you?<br />
list to my lady's words:<br />
thus, look you, she hath spoken:<br />
"Go order him,<br />
and understand it,<br />
I&mdash;Isolda&mdash;<br />
do command it."</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>springing up</i>). May I an answer make her?</p>
<p>TRISTAN. What wouldst thou wish to reply?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. This should she say<br />
to Dame Isold':<br />
"Though Cornwall's crown<br />
and England's isle<br />
for Ireland's child he chose,<br />
his own by choice<br />
she may not be;<br />
he brings the king his bride.<br />
A hero-knight<br />
Tristan is hight!<br />
I've said, nor care to measure<br />
your lady's high displeasure."</p>
<p>[<i>While</i> TRISTAN <i>seeks to stop him, and the offended</i>
BRANG&AElig;NA <i>turns to depart</i>, KURVENAL <i>sings after her
at the top of his voice, as she lingeringly withdraws</i>.]</p>
<p>"Sir Morold toiled<br />
o'er mighty wave<br />
the Cornish tax to levy;<br />
In desert isle<br />
was dug his grave,<br />
he died of wounds so heavy.<br />
His head now hangs<br />
in Irish lands,<br />
Sole were-gild won<br />
at English hands.<br />
Bravo, our brave Tristan!<br />
Let his tax take who can!"</p>
<p>[KURVENAL, <i>driven away by</i> TRISTAN'S <i>chidings, descends
into the cabin</i>. BRANG&AElig;NA <i>returns in discomposure
to</i> ISOLDA, <i>closing the curtains behind her, while all the
men take up the chorus and are heard without</i>.]</p>
<p>KNIGHTS AND ATTENDANTS.<br />
"His head now hangs<br />
in Irish lands,<br />
sole were-gild won<br />
at English hands.<br />
Bravo, our brave Tristan!<br />
Let his tax take who can!"</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p>[ISOLDA <i>and</i> BRANG&AElig;NA <i>alone, the curtain being
again completely closed</i>. ISOLDA <i>rises with a gesture of
despair and wrath</i>. BRANG&AElig;NA <i>falls at her
feet</i>.]</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Ah! an answer<br />
so insulting!</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>checking herself on the brink of a fearful
outburst</i>).<br />
How now? of Tristan?<br />
I'd know if he denies me.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Ah! question not!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Quick, say without fear!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. With courteous phrase<br />
he foiled my will.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. But when you bade him hither?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. When I had straightway<br />
bid him come,<br />
where'er he stood,<br />
he said to me,<br />
he truly served but thee,<br />
the pearl of womanhood;<br />
if he unheeded<br />
left the helm<br />
how could he pilot the ship<br />
in surety to King Mark?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>bitterly</i>).<br />
"How could he pilot the ship<br />
in surety to King Mark!"<br />
And wait on him with were-gild<br />
from Ireland's island won!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
As I gave out the message<br />
and in thy very words,<br />
thus spoke his henchman Kurvenal&mdash;</p>
<p>ISOLDA.<br />
Heard I not ev'ry sentence?<br />
it all has reached my ear.<br />
If thou hast learnt my disgrace<br />
now hear too whence it has grown.<br />
<span class="indent">How scoffingly</span><br />
<span class="indent">they sing about me!</span><br />
Quickly could I requite them!<br />
<span class="indent">What of the boat</span><br />
<span class="indent">so bare and frail,</span><br />
that floated by our shore?<br />
<span class="indent">What of the broken</span><br />
<span class="indent">stricken man,</span><br />
feebly extended there?<br />
<span class="indent">Isolda's art</span><br />
<span class="indent">he gladly owned;</span><br />
<span class="indent">with herbs, simples</span><br />
<span class="indent">and healing salves</span><br />
the wounds from which he suffered<br />
she nursed in skilful wise.<br />
<span class="indent">Though "Tantris"</span><br />
The name that he took unto him,<br />
<span class="indent">as "Tristan"</span><br />
anon Isolda knew him,<br />
when in the sick man's keen blade<br />
she perceived a notch had been made,<br />
<span class="indent">wherein did fit</span><br />
<span class="indent">a splinter broken</span><br />
in Morold's head,<br />
the mangled token<br />
sent home in hatred rare:<br />
this hand did find it there.<br />
I heard a voice<br />
from distance dim;<br />
with the sword in hand<br />
I came to him.<br />
Full well I willed to slay him,<br />
for Morold's death to pay him.<br />
But from his sick bed<br />
he looked up<br />
not at the sword,<br />
not at my arm&mdash;<br />
his eyes on mine were fastened,<br />
and his feebleness<br />
softened my heart:<br />
the sword&mdash;dropped from my fingers.<br />
Though Morold's steel had maimed him<br />
to health again I reclaimed him!<br />
when he hath homeward wended<br />
my emotion then might be ended.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
O wondrous! Why could I not see this?<br />
The guest I sometime<br />
helped to nurse&mdash;?</p>
<p>ISOLDA.<br />
His praise briskly they sing now:&mdash;<br />
"Bravo, our brave Tristan!"&mdash;<br />
he was that distressful man.<br />
A thousand protestations<br />
of truth and love he prated.<br />
Hear how a knight<br />
fealty knows!&mdash;<br />
When as Tantris<br />
unforbidden he'd left me,<br />
as Tristan<br />
boldly back he came,<br />
in stately ship<br />
from which in pride<br />
Ireland's heiress<br />
in marriage he asked<br />
for Mark, the Cornish monarch,<br />
his kinsman worn and old.<br />
In Morold's lifetime<br />
dared any have dreamed<br />
to offer us such an insult?<br />
For the tax-paying<br />
Cornish prince<br />
to presume to court Ireland's princess!<br />
Ah, woe is me!<br />
I it was<br />
who for myself<br />
did shape this shame!<br />
with death-dealing sword<br />
should I have stabbed him;<br />
weakly it escaped me:&mdash;<br />
now serfdom I have shaped me.<br />
Curse him, the villain!<br />
Curse on his head!<br />
Vengeance! Death!<br />
Death for me too!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>throwing herself upon</i> ISOLDA <i>with
impetuous tenderness</i>).<br />
Isolda! lady!<br />
loved one! fairest!<br />
sweet perfection!<br />
mistress rarest!<br />
Hear me! come now,<br />
sit thee here.&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Gradually draws</i> ISOLDA <i>to the couch</i>.)</p>
<p>What a whim!<br />
what causeless railing!<br />
How came you so wrong-minded<br />
and by mere fancy blinded?<br />
Sir Tristan gives thee<br />
Cornwall's kingdom;<br />
then, were he erst thy debtor,<br />
how could he reward thee better?<br />
His noble uncle<br />
serves he so:<br />
think too what a gift<br />
on thee he'd bestow!<br />
With honor unequalled<br />
all he's heir to<br />
at thy feet he seeks to shower,<br />
to make thee a queenly dower.</p>
<p>(ISOLDA <i>turns away</i>.)</p>
<p>If wife he'd make thee<br />
unto King Mark<br />
why wert thou in this wise complaining?<br />
Is he not worth thy gaining?<br />
Of royal race<br />
and mild of mood,<br />
who passes King Mark<br />
in might and power?<br />
If a noble knight<br />
like Tristan serves him,<br />
who would not but feel elated,<br />
so fairly to be mated.</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>gazing vacantly before her</i>).<br />
Glorious knight!<br />
And I must near him<br />
loveless ever languish!<br />
How can I support such anguish?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
What's this, my lady?<br />
loveless thou?</p>
<p>(<i>Approaching coaxingly and kissing</i> ISOLDA.)</p>
<p>Where lives there a man<br />
would not love thee?<br />
Who could see Isolda<br />
And not sink<br />
at once into bondage blest?<br />
And if e'en it could be<br />
any were cold,<br />
did any magic<br />
draw him from thee,<br />
I'd bring the false one<br />
back to bondage,<br />
And bind him in links of love.&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Secretly and confidentially, close to</i> ISOLDA.)</p>
<p>Mindest thou not<br />
thy mother's arts?<br />
Think you that she<br />
who'd mastered those<br />
would have sent me o'er the sea,<br />
without assistance for thee?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>darkly</i>).<br />
My mother's rede<br />
I mind aright,<br />
and highly her magic<br />

It holds a balm for thee.&mdash;</p>

<p>Thy mother placed inside it<br />
her subtle magic potions.<br />
There's salve for sickness<br />

<p>(<i>She takes a bottle</i>.)</p>
<p>The helpfullest draught<br />
I hold in here.</p>
<p>ISOLDA.<br />
Not so, I know a better.<br />
I make a mark<br />
to know it again&mdash;<br />
This draught 'tis I would drain.</p>
<p>(<i>Seizes flask and shows it</i>.)</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>recoiling in horror</i>).<br />
The draught of death!</p>

Our journey has been swift.<br />
Woe is me! Near to the land!</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>(KURVENAL <i>boisterously enters through the curtains</i>.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL.<br />
Up, up, ye ladies!<br />
Look alert!<br />
Straight bestir you!<br />
Loiter not,&mdash;here is the land!&mdash;<br />
To dame Isolda<br />
says the servant<br />
of Tristan,<br />
our hero true:&mdash;<br />
Behold our flag is flying!<br />
it waveth landwards aloft:<br />
in Mark's ancestral castle<br />
may our approach be seen.<br />
So, dame Isolda,<br />
he prays to hasten,<br />
for land straight to prepare her,<br />
that thither he may bear her.</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>who has at first cowered and shuddered on hearing the
message, now speaks calmly and with dignity</i>). My greeting
take<br />
unto your lord<br />
and tell him what I say now:<br />
Should he assist to land me<br />
and to King Mark would he hand me,<br />
unmeet and unseemly<br />
were his act,<br />
the while my pardon<br />
was not won<br />
for trespass black and base:<br />
So bid him seek my grace.</p>
<p>(KURVENAL <i>makes a gesture of defiance</i>.)</p>
<p>Now mark me well,<br />
This message take:&mdash;<br />
Nought will I yet prepare me,<br />
that he to land may bear me;<br />
I will not by him be landed,<br />
nor unto King Mark be handed<br />
ere granting forgiveness<br />
and forgetfulness,<br />
which 'tis seemly<br />
he should seek:&mdash;<br />
for all his trespass base<br />
I tender him my grace.</p>
<p>KURVENAL.<br />
Be assured,<br />
I'll bear your words:<br />
we'll see what he will say!</p>
<p>(<i>He retires quickly</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>hurries to</i> BRANG&AElig;NA <i>and embraces her
vehemently</i>).<br />
Now farewell, Brang&aelig;na!<br />
Greet ev'ry one,<br />
Greet my father and mother!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
What now? what mean'st thou?<br />
Wouldst thou flee?<br />
And where must I then follow?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>checking herself suddenly</i>).<br />
Here I remain:<br />
heard you not?<br />
Tristan will I await.&mdash;<br />
I trust in thee<br />
to aid in this:<br />
prepare the true<br />
cup of peace:<br />
thou mindest how it is made.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
What meanest thou?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>taking a bottle from the coffer</i>).<br />
This it is!<br />
From the flask go pour<br />
this philtre out;<br />
yon golden goblet 'twill fill.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>filled with terror receiving the
flask</i>).<br />
Trust I my wits?</p>
<p>ISOLDA.<br />
Wilt thou be true?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA.<br />
The draught&mdash;for whom?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Him who betrayed!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Tristan?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Truce he'll drink with me.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>throwing herself at</i> ISOLDA'S
<i>feet</i>). O horror!<br />
Pity thy handmaid!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Pity thou me,<br />
false-hearted maid!<br />
Mindest thou not<br />
my mother's arts?<br />
Think you that she<br />
who'd mastered those<br />
would have sent thee o'er the sea<br />
without assistance for me?<br />
A salve for sickness<br />
doth she offer<br />
and antidotes<br />
for deadly drugs:<br />
for deepest grief<br />
and woe supreme<br />
gave she the draught of death.<br />
Let Death now give her thanks!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>scarcely able to control herself</i>). O
deepest<br />
grief!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Now, wilt thou obey?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. O woe supreme!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. The draught?</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>entering</i>). Sir Tristan!</p>
<p>(BRANG&AElig;NA <i>rises, terrified and confused</i>. ISOLDA
<i>strives with immense effort to control herself</i>.)</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>to Kurvenal</i>). Sir Tristan may approach!</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p>[KURVENAL <i>retires again</i>. BRANG&AElig;NA, <i>almost beside
herself, turns up the stage</i>. ISOLDA, <i>mustering all her
powers of resolution, walks slowly and with dignity towards the
sofa, by the head of which she supports herself, turning her eyes
firmly towards the entrance</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Demand, lady,<br />
what you will.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. While knowing not<br />
what my demand is,<br />
wert thou afraid<br />
still to fulfil it,<br />
fleeing my presence thus?</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Honor<br />
Held me in awe.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Scant honor hast thou<br />
shown unto me;<br />
for, unabashed,<br />
withheldest thou<br />
obedience unto my call.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Obedience 'twas<br />
forbade me to come.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. But little I owe<br />
thy lord, methinks,<br />
if he allows<br />
ill manners<br />
unto his own promised bride.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. In our land<br />
it is the law<br />
that he who fetches<br />
home the bride<br />
should stay afar from her.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. On what account?</p>
<p>TRISTAN. 'Tis the custom.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Being so careful,<br />
my lord Tristan,<br />
another custom<br />
can you not learn?<br />
Of enemies friends make:<br />
for evil acts amends make.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Who is my foe?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Find in thy fears!<br />
Blood-guilt<br />
gets between us.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. That was absolved.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Not between us.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. In open field,<br />
'fore all the folk<br />
our old feud was abandoned.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. 'Twas not there<br />
I held Tantris hid<br />
when Tristan was laid low,<br />
He stood there brawny,<br />
bright and brave;<br />
but in his truce<br />
I took no part:<br />
my tongue its silence had learnt.<br />
When in chambered stillness<br />
sick he lay<br />
with the sword I stood<br />
before him, stern;<br />
silent&mdash;my lips,<br />
motionless&mdash;my hand.<br />
But that which my hand<br />
and lips had once vowed,<br />
I swore in stealth to adhere to:<br />
lo! now my desire I'm near to.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. What hast thou sworn?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>quickly</i>). Vengeance for Morold!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>quietly</i>). Mindst thou that?</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>animated</i>). Dare you to flout me?&mdash;<br />
Was he not my betrothed,<br />
that noble Irish knight?<br />
For his sword a blessing I sought;<br />
for me only he fought.<br />
When he was murdered<br />
no honor fell.<br />
In that heartfelt misery<br />
my vow was framed;<br />
if no man remained to right it,<br />
I, a maid, must needs requite it.&mdash;<br />
Weak and maimed,<br />
when might was mine,<br />
why at thy death did I pause?<br />
Thou shalt know the secret cause.&mdash;<br />
Thy hurts I tended<br />
that, when sickness ended,<br />
thou shouldst fall by some man,<br />
as Isolda's revenge should plan.<br />
But now attempt<br />
thy fate to foretell me?<br />
if their friendship all men do sell thee,<br />
what foe can seek to fell thee?</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>pale and gloomy, offers her his sword</i>). If<br />
thou so lovedst this lord,<br />
then lift once more my sword,<br />
nor from thy purpose refrain;<br />
let the weapon not fail again.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Put up thy sword<br />
which once I swung,<br />
when vengeful rancor<br />
my bosom wrung,<br />
when thy masterful eyes<br />
did ask me straight<br />
whether King Mark<br />
might seek me for mate.<br />
The sword harmless descended.&mdash;<br />
Drink, let our strife be ended!</p>
<p>(ISOLDA <i>beckons</i> BRANG&AElig;NA. <i>She trembles and
hesitates to obey</i>. ISOLDA <i>commands her with a more imperious
gesture</i>. BRANG&AElig;NA <i>sets about preparing the

Ho! heave ho! hey!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>starting from his gloomy brooding</i>). Where<br />
are we?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Near to shore.<br />
Tristan, is warfare ended?<br />
Hast not a word to offer?</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>darkly</i>). Concealment's mistress<br />
makes me silent:<br />
I know what she conceals,<br />
conceal, too, more than she knows.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Thy silence nought<br />
but feigning I deem.<br />
Friendship wilt thou still deny?</p>
<p>(<i>Renewed cries of the Sailors</i>.)</p>
<p>(<i>At an impatient sign from</i> ISOLDA BRANG&AElig;NA <i>hands
her the filled cup</i>.)</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>advancing with the cup to</i> TRISTAN, <i>who gazes
immovably into her eyes</i>).<br />
Thou hear'st the cry?<br />
The shore's in sight:<br />
we must ere long (<i>with slight scorn</i>)<br />
stand by King Mark together.</p>
<p>SAILORS (<i>without</i>). Haul the warp!<br />
Anchor down!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>starting wildly</i>). Down with the anchor!<br />
Her stern to the stream!<br />
The sails a-weather the mast!</p>
<p>(<i>He takes the cup from</i> ISOLDA.)</p>
<p>I know the Queen<br />
of Ireland well,<br />

her magic arts:<br />
the balsam cured me<br />

now bid me quaff the cup,<br />
that I may quite recover.<br />

<p>ISOLDA. Betrayed e'en here?<br />
I must halve it!&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>She wrests the cup from his hand</i>.)</p>
<p>Betrayer, I drink to thee!</p>
<p>[<i>She drinks, and then throws away the cup. Both, seized with
shuddering, gaze with deepest emotion, but immovable demeanor, into
one another's eyes, in which the expression of defiance to death
fades and melts into the glow of passion. Trembling seizes them,
they convulsively clutch their hearts and pass their hands over
their brows. Their glances again seek to meet, sink in confusion,
and once more turn with growing longing upon one another</i>.]</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>with trembling voice</i>). Tristan!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>overpowered</i>). Isolda!</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>sinking upon his breast</i>). Traitor beloved!</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Woman divine!</p>
<p>(<i>He embraces her with ardor. They remain in a silent
embrace</i>.)</p>

Hail our monarch!<br />
Hail to Mark, the king!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>who, filled with confusion and horror, has
leaned over the side with averted face, now turns to behold the
pair locked in their close embrace, and rushes to the front,
wringing her hands in despair</i>). Woe's me! Woe's me!<br />
Endless mis'ry<br />
I have wrought<br />
instead of death!<br />
Dire the deed<br />
of my dull fond heart:<br />
it cries aloud to heav'n!</p>
<p>(<i>They start from their embrace</i>.)</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>bewildered</i>). What troubled dream<br />
of Tristan's honor?</p>
<p>ISOLDA. What troubled dream<br />
Of Isolda's shame?</p>

Gladly he stems the tide,<br />

<p>TRISTAN (<i>looking up in bewilderment</i>). Who comes?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The king 'tis.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. What king mean you?</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>
<p>[<i>A Garden before ISOLDA'S Chamber which lies at one side and
is approached by steps. Bright and pleasant summer night. At the
open door a burning torch is fixed. Sounds of hunting
heard</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p>[BRANG&AElig;NA, <i>on the steps leading to the chamber, is
watching the retreat of the still audible hunters. She looks
anxiously back into the chamber as ISOLDA emerges thence in ardent
animation</i>.]</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Yet do you hear?<br />
I lost the sound some time.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>listening</i>). Still do they stay:<br />
clearly rings the horns.</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>listening</i>). Fear but deludes<br />
thy anxious ear;<br />
by sounds of rustling<br />
leaves thou'rt deceived,<br />
aroused by laughter of winds.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Deceived by wild<br />
desire art thou,<br />
and but hear'st as would thy will:&mdash;<br />
I still hear the sound of horns.</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>listens</i>). No sound of horns<br />
were so sweet:<br />
yon fountain's soft<br />
murmuring current<br />
moves so quietly hence.<br />
If horns yet brayed,<br />
how could I hear that?<br />
In still night alone<br />
it laughs on mine ear.<br />
My lov'd one hides<br />
in darkness unseen:<br />
wouldst thou hold from my side my dearest?<br />
deeming that horns thou hearest?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Thy lov'd one hid&mdash;<br />
oh heed my warning!&mdash;<br />
for him a spy waits by night.<br />
Listening oft<br />
I light upon him:<br />
he lays a secret snare.<br />
Of Melot oh beware!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Mean you Sir Melot?<br />
O, how you mistake!<br />
Is he not Tristan's<br />
trustiest friend?<br />
May my true love not meet me,<br />
with none but Melot he stays.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. What moves me to fear him<br />
makes thee his friend then?<br />
Through Tristan to Mark's side<br />
is Melot's way:<br />
he sows suspicion's seed.<br />
And those who have<br />
to-day on a night-hunt<br />
so suddenly decided,<br />
a far nobler game<br />
than is guessed by thee<br />
taxes their hunting skill.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. For Tristan's sake<br />
contrived was this scheme<br />
by means of<br />
Melot, in truth:<br />
now would you decry his friendship?<br />
He serves Isolda<br />
better than you<br />
his hand gives help<br />
which yours denies:<br />
what need of such delay?<br />
The signal, Brang&aelig;na!<br />
O give the signal!<br />
Tread out the torch's<br />
trembling gleam,<br />
that night may envelop<br />
all with her veil.<br />
Already her peace reigns<br />
o'er hill and hall,<br />
her rapturous awe<br />
the heart does enthral;<br />
allow then the light to fall!<br />
Let but its dread lustre die!<br />
let my beloved draw nigh!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. The light of warning suppress not!<br />
Let it remind thee of peril!&mdash;<br />
Ah, woe's me! Woe's me!<br />
Fatal folly!<br />
The fell pow'r of that potion!<br />
That I framed<br />
a fraud for once<br />
thy orders to oppose!<br />
Had I been deaf and blind,<br />
thy work<br />
were then thy death:<br />
but thy distress,<br />
thy distraction of grief,<br />
my work<br />
has contrived them, I own it!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Thy&mdash;act?<br />
O foolish girl!<br />
Love's goddess dost thou not know?<br />
nor all her magic arts?<br />
The queen who grants<br />
unquailing hearts,<br />
the witch whose will<br />
the world obeys,<br />
life and death<br />
she holds in her hands,<br />
which of joy and woe are wove?<br />
she worketh hate into love.<br />
The work of death<br />
I took into my own hands;<br />
Love's goddess saw<br />
and gave her good commands<br />
The death&mdash;condemned<br />
she claimed as her prey,<br />
planning our fate<br />
in her own way.<br />
How she may bend it,<br />
how she may end it,<br />
what she may make me,<br />
wheresoe'er take me,<br />
still hers am I solely;&mdash;<br />
so let me obey her wholly.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. And if by the artful<br />
love-potion's lures<br />
thy light of reason is ravished,<br />
if thou art reckless<br />
when I would warn thee,<br />
this once, oh, wait<br />
and weigh my pleading!<br />
I implore, leave it alight!&mdash;<br />
The torch! the torch!<br />
O put it not out this night!</p>
<p>ISOLDA. She who causes thus<br />
my bosom's throes,<br />
whose eager fire<br />
within me glows,<br />
whose light upon<br />
my spirit flows,<br />
Love's goddess needs<br />
that night should close;<br />
that brightly she may reign<br />
and shun the torchlight vain.</p>
<p>(<i>She goes up to the door and takes down the torch</i>.)</p>
<p>Go watch without&mdash;<br />
keep wary guard!<br />
The signal!&mdash;<br />
and were it my spirit's spark,<br />
smiling<br />
I'd destroy it and hail the dark!</p>
<p>[<i>She throws the torch to the ground where it slowly dies out.
BRANG&AElig;NA turns away, disturbed, and mounts an outer flight of
steps leading to the roof, where she slowly disappears. ISOLDA
listens and peers, at first shyly, towards an avenue. Urged, by
rising impatience, she then approaches the avenue and looks more
boldly. She signs with her handkerchief, first slightly, then more
plainly, waving it quicker as her impatience increases. A gesture
of sudden delight shows that she has perceived her lover in the
distance. She stretches herself higher and higher, and then, to
look better over the intervening space, hastens back to the steps,
from the top of which she signals again to the on-comer. As he
enters, she springs to meet him</i>.]</p>

<p>TRISTAN (<i>rushing in</i>). Isolda! Beloved!</p>

O but this light,<br />
how long 'twas let to burn!<br />
The sun had sunk,<br />
the day had fled;<br />
but all their spite<br />
not yet was sped:<br />
the scaring signal<br />
they set alight,<br />
before my belov'd one's dwelling,<br />
my swift approach repelling.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Thy belov'd one's hand<br />
lowered the light,<br />
for Brang&aelig;na's fears<br />
in me roused no fright:<br />
while Love's goddess gave me aid,<br />
sunlight a mock I made.<br />

must thou straightway surrender,<br />
that it should<br />
exist in bright<br />
bonds of empty splendor.&mdash;<br />

<p>TRISTAN. O now were we<br />
to night devoted,<br />
the dishonest day<br />
with envy bloated,<br />
lying, could not mislead,<br />
though it might part us indeed.<br />
Its pretentious glows<br />
and its glamouring light<br />
are scouted by those<br />
who worship night.<br />
All its flickering gleams<br />
in flashes out-blazing<br />
blind us no more<br />
where we are gazing.<br />
Those who death's night<br />
boldly survey,<br />
those who have studied<br />
her secret way,<br />
the daylight's falsehoods&mdash;<br />
rank and fame,<br />
honor and all<br />
at which men aim&mdash;<br />
to them are no more matter<br />
than dust which sunbeams scatter,<br />

<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p>[BRANG&AElig;NA <i>utters a piercing cry</i>. TRISTAN <i>and</i>
ISOLDA <i>remain in their absorbed state</i>. KURVENAL <i>rushes in
with drawn sword</i>.]</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Save yourself, Tristan!</p>
<p>[<i>He looks fearfully off behind him</i>. MARK, MELOT, <i>and
courtiers, in hunting dress, come swiftly up the avenue and pause
in the foreground in consternation before the lovers</i>.
BRANG&AElig;NA <i>at the same time descends from the roof and
hastens towards</i> ISOLDA. <i>The latter in involuntary shame
leans on the flowery bank with averted face</i>. TRISTAN <i>with an
equally unconscious action stretches his mantle wide out with one
arm, so as to conceal</i> ISOLDA <i>from the gaze of the
new-comers. In this position he remains for some time, turning a
changeless look upon the men, who gaze at him in varied emotion.
The morning dawns</i>.]</p>
<p>TRISTAN. The dreary day&mdash;<br />
its last time comes!</p>
<p>MELOT (<i>to Mark</i>). Now say to me, my sov'reign,<br />
was my impeachment just?<br />
I staked my head thereon:<br />
How is the pledge redeemed?<br />
Behold him in<br />
the very act:<br />
honor and fame,<br />
faithfully I<br />
have saved from shame for thee.</p>
<p>MARK (<i>deeply moved, with trembling voice</i>). Hast
thou<br />
preserved them?<br />
Say'st thou so?&mdash;<br />
See him there,<br />
the truest of all true hearts!<br />
Look on him<br />
the faithfulest of friends, too<br />
His offence<br />
so black and base<br />
fills my heart<br />
with anguish and disgrace.<br />
Tristan traitor,<br />
what hope stayeth<br />
that the honor<br />
he betrayeth<br />
should by Melot's rede<br />
rest to me indeed?</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>with convulsive violence</i>). Daylight
phantoms&mdash;<br />
morning visions<br />
empty and vain&mdash;<br />
Avaunt! Begone!</p>
<p>MARK (<i>in deep emotion</i>). This&mdash;blow.<br />
Tristan, to me?<br />
Where now has truth fled,<br />
if Tristan can betray?<br />
Where now are faith<br />
and friendship fair,<br />
when from the fount of faith,<br />
my Tristan, they are gone?<br />
The buckler Tristan<br />
once did don,<br />
where is that shield<br />
of virtue now?<br />
when from my friends it flies,<br />
and Tristan's honor dies?</p>
<p>(TRISTAN <i>slowly lowers his eyes to the ground. His features
express increasing grief while MARK continues</i>.)</p>
<p>Why hast thou noble<br />
service done,<br />
and honor, fame<br />
and potent might<br />
amassed for Mark, thy king?<br />
Must honor, fame,<br />
power and might,<br />
must all thy noble<br />
service done<br />
be paid with Mark's dishonor?<br />
Seemed the reward<br />
too slight and scant<br />
that what thou hast won him&mdash;<br />
realms and riches&mdash;<br />
thou art the heir unto, all?<br />
When childless he lost<br />
once a wife,<br />
he loved thee so<br />
that ne'er again<br />
did Mark desire to marry.<br />
When all his subjects,<br />
high and low,<br />
demands and pray'rs,<br />
on him did press<br />
to choose himself a consort&mdash;<br />
a queen to give the kingdom,<br />
when thou thyself<br />
thy uncle urged<br />
that what the court<br />
and country pleaded<br />
well might be conceded,<br />
opposing high and low,<br />
opposing e'en thyself,<br />
with kindly cunning<br />
still he refused,<br />
till, Tristan, thou didst threaten<br />
forever to leave<br />
both court and land<br />
if thou receivedst<br />
not command<br />
a bride for the king to woo:<br />
then so he let thee do.&mdash;<br />
This wondrous lovely wife,<br />
thy might for me did win,<br />
who could behold her,<br />
who address her,<br />
who in pride<br />
and bliss possess her,<br />
but would bless his happy fortune?<br />
She whom I have<br />
paid respect to ever,<br />
whom I owned,<br />
yet possess'd her never<br />
she, the princess<br />
proud and peerless,<br />
lighting up<br />
my life so cheerless,<br />
'spite foes,&mdash;without fear,<br />
the fairest of brides<br />
thou didst bring me here.<br />
Why in hell must I bide,<br />
without hope of a heaven?<br />
Why endure disgrace<br />
unhealed by tears or grief?<br />
The unexplained,<br />
unpenetrated<br />
cause of all these woes,<br />
who will to us disclose?</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>raising his eyes pitifully towards</i> MARK).<br />
O monarch! I&mdash;<br />
may not tell thee, truly;<br />
what thou dost ask<br />
remains for aye unanswered.&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>He turns to</i> ISOLDA, <i>who looks tenderly up at
him</i>.)</p>
<p>Where Tristan now is going,<br />
wilt thou, Isolda, follow?<br />
The land that Tristan means<br />
of sunlight has no gleams;<br />
it is the dark<br />
abode of night,<br />
from whence I first<br />
came forth to light,<br />
and she who bore me<br />
thence in anguish,<br />
gave up her life,<br />
nor long did languish.<br />
She but looked on my face,<br />
then sought this resting-place.<br />
This land where Night doth reign,<br />
where Tristan once hath lain&mdash;<br />
now thither offers he<br />
thy faithful guide to be.<br />
So let Isolda<br />
straight declare<br />
if she will meet him there.</p>
<p>ISOLDA. When to a foreign land<br />
before thou didst invite,<br />
to thee, traitor,<br />
resting true,<br />
did Isolda follow.<br />
Thy kingdom now art showing,<br />
where surely we are going!<br />
why should I shun that land<br />
by which the world is spann'd?<br />
For Tristan's house and home<br />
Isold' will make her own.<br />
The road whereby<br />
we have to go<br />
I pray thee quickly show!&mdash;</p>
<p>(TRISTAN <i>bends slowly over her and kisses her softly on the
forehead</i>. MELOT <i>starts furiously forward</i>.)</p>
<p>MELOT (<i>drawing his sword</i>). Thou villain! Ha!<br />
Avenge thee, monarch!<br />
Say, wilt suffer such scorn?</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>drawing his sword and turning quickly
round</i>)<br />
Who's he will set his life against mine?</p>
<p>(<i>casting a look at MELOT</i>).</p>
<p>This was my friend;<br />
he told me he loved me truly:<br />
my fame and honor<br />
he upheld more than all men.<br />
With arrogance<br />
he filled my heart,<br />
and led on those<br />
who prompted me<br />
fame and pow'r to augment me<br />
by wedding thee to our monarch.&mdash;<br />
Thy glance, Isolda,<br />
glamoured him thus;<br />
and, jealous, my friend<br />
played me false<br />
to King Mark, whom I betrayed.&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>He sets on</i> MELOT.)</p>
<p>Guard thee, Melot!</p>
<p>[<i>As</i> MELOT <i>presents his sword</i> TRISTAN <i>drops his
own guard and sinks wounded into the arms of</i> KURVENAL. ISOLDA
<i>throws herself upon his breast</i>. MARK <i>holds</i> MELOT
<i>back. The curtain falls quickly</i>.]</p>
<br />
<h3>ACT III.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>A Castle-Garden</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>At one side high castellated buildings, on the other a low
breastwork interrupted by a watch tower; at back the castle-gate.
The situation is supposed to be on rocky cliffs; through openings
the view extends over a wide sea horizon. The whole gives an
impression of being deserted by the owner, badly kept, and here and
there dilapidated and overgrown</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p>[<i>In the foreground, in the garden, lies</i> TRISTAN
<i>sleeping on a couch under the shade of a great lime-tree,
stretched out as if lifeless. At his head sits</i> KURVENAL,
<i>bending over him in grief and anxiously listening to his
breathing. From without comes the mournful sound of a shepherd's
pipe</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Presently the shepherd comes and looks in with interest,
showing the upper half of his body over the wall</i>.]</p>
<p>SHEPHERD. Kurvenal, ho!&mdash;<br />
Say, Kurvenal,&mdash;<br />
tell me, friend!<br />
Does he still sleep?</p>
<p>KURVENAL (turning a little towards him and shaking his head
sadly). If he awoke<br />
it would be<br />
but for evermore to leave us,<br />
unless we find<br />
the lady-leech;<br />
alone can she give help.&mdash;<br />
See'st thou nought?<br />
No ship yet on the sea?</p>
<p>SHEPHERD. Quite another ditty<br />
then would I play<br />
as merry as ever I may.<br />
But tell me truly,<br />
trusty friend,<br />
why languishes our lord?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Do not ask me;&mdash;<br />
for I can give no answer.<br />
Watch the sea,<br />
if sails come in sight<br />
a sprightly melody play.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD (<i>turns round and scans the horizon, shading his eyes
with his hand</i>).<br />
Blank appears the sea!</p>
<p>(<i>He puts the reed pipe to his mouth and withdraws,
playing</i>.)</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>motionless&mdash;faintly</i>).<br />
The tune so well known&mdash;<br />
why wake to that?</p>
<p>(<i>opens his eyes and slightly turns his head</i>).</p>
<p>Where am I?</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>starting in joyous surprise</i>).<br />
Ha!&mdash;who is speaking?<br />
It is his voice!&mdash;<br />
Tristan! lov'd one!<br />
My lord! my Tristan!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>with effort</i>). Who&mdash;calls me?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Life&mdash;at last&mdash;<br />
O thanks be to heaven!&mdash;<br />
sweetest life<br />
unto my Tristan newly given!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>faintly</i>). Kurvenal!&mdash;thou?<br />
Where&mdash;was I?&mdash;<br />
Where&mdash;am I?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Where art thou?<br />
In safety, tranquil and sure!<br />
Kareol 'tis;<br />
dost thou not know<br />
thy fathers' halls?</p>
<p>TRISTAN. This my fathers'?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Look but around.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. What awoke me?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The herdsman's ditty<br />
hast thou heard, doubtless;<br />
he heedeth thy herds<br />
above on the hills there.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Have I herds, then?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Sir, I say it!<br />
Thine are court,<br />
castle&mdash;all.<br />
To thee yet true,<br />
thy trusty folk,<br />
as best they might,<br />
have held thy home in guard:<br />
the gift which once<br />
thy goodness gave<br />
to thy serfs and vassals here,<br />
when going far away,<br />
in foreign lands to dwell.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. What foreign land?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Why! in Cornwall;<br />
where cool and able,<br />
all that was brilliant,<br />
brave and noble,<br />
Tristan, my lord, lightly took.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Am I in Cornwall?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. No, no; in Kareol.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. How came I here?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Hey now! how you came?<br />
No horse hither you rode:<br />
a vessel bore you across.<br />
But on my shoulders<br />
down to the ship<br />
you had to ride: they are broad,<br />
they carried you to the shore.<br />
Now you are at home once more;<br />
your own the land,<br />
your native land;<br />
all loved things now are near you,<br />
unchanged the sun doth cheer you.<br />
The wounds from which you languish<br />
here all shall end their anguish.</p>
<p>(<i>He presses himself to</i> TRISTAN'S <i>breast</i>.)</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Think'st thou thus!<br />
I know 'tis not so,<br />
but this I cannot tell thee.<br />
Where I awoke<br />
ne'er I was,<br />
but where I wandered<br />
I can indeed not tell thee.<br />
The sun I could not see,<br />
nor country fair, nor people;<br />
but what I saw<br />
I can indeed not tell thee.<br />
It was&mdash;<br />
the land from which I once came<br />
and whither I return:<br />
the endless realm<br />
of earthly night.<br />
One thing only<br />
there possessed me:<br />
blank, unending,<br />
all-oblivion.&mdash;<br />
How faded all forebodings!<br />
O wistful goadings!&mdash;<br />
Thus I call<br />
the thoughts that all<br />
t'ward light of day have press'd me.<br />
What only yet doth rest me,<br />
the love-pains that possess'd me,<br />
from blissful death's affright<br />
now drive me toward the light,<br />
which, deceitful, bright and golden,<br />
round thee, Isolda, shines.<br />
Accurs&eacute;d day<br />
with cruel glow!<br />
Must thou ever<br />
wake my woe?<br />
Must thy light<br />
be burning ever,<br />
e'en by night<br />
our hearts to sever?<br />
Ah, my fairest,<br />
sweetest, rarest!<br />
When wilt thou&mdash;<br />
when, ah, when&mdash;<br />
let the torchlight dwindle,<br />
that so my bliss may kindle?<br />
The light, how long it glows!<br />
When will the house repose?</p>
<p>(<i>His voice has grown fainter and he sinks back gently,
exhausted</i>.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>who has been deeply distressed, now quickly rousts
himself from his dejection</i>).<br />
I once defied,<br />
through faith in thee,<br />
the one for whom<br />
now with thee I'm yearning.<br />
Trust in my words,<br />
thou soon shalt see her<br />
face to face.<br />
My tongue that comfort giveth,&mdash;<br />
if on the earth still she liveth.</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>very feebly</i>). Yet burns the beacon's
spark:<br />
yet is the house not dark,<br />
Isolda lives and wakes:<br />
her voice through darkness breaks.</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Lives she still,<br />
then let new hope delight thee.<br />
If foolish and dull you hold me,<br />
this day you must not scold me.<br />
As dead lay'st thou<br />
since the day<br />
when that accursed Melot<br />
so foully wounded thee.<br />
Thy wound was heavy:<br />
how to heal it?<br />
Thy simple servant<br />
there bethought<br />
that she who once<br />
closed Morold's wound<br />
with ease the hurt could heal thee<br />
that Melot's sword did deal thee.<br />
I found the best<br />
of leeches there,<br />
to Cornwall have I<br />
sent for her:<br />
a trusty serf<br />
sails o'er the sea,<br />
bringing Isold' to thee.</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>transported</i>). Isolda comes!<br />
Isolda nears! (He struggles for words.)<br />
O friendship! high<br />
and holy friendship!</p>
<p>(<i>Draws</i> KURVENAL <i>to him and embraces him</i>.)</p>
<p>O Kurvenal,<br />
thou trusty heart,<br />
my truest friend I rank thee!<br />
Howe'er can Tristan thank thee?<br />
My shelter and shield<br />
in fight and strife;<br />
in weal or woe<br />
thou'rt mine for life.<br />
Those whom I hate<br />
thou hatest too;<br />
those whom I love<br />
thou lovest too.<br />
When good King Mark<br />
I followed of old,<br />
thou wert to him truer than gold.<br />
When I was false<br />
to my noble friend,<br />
to betray too thou didst descend.<br />
Thou art selfless,<br />
solely mine;<br />
thou feel'st for me<br />
when I suffer.<br />
But&mdash;what I suffer,<br />
thou canst not feel for me!<br />
this terrible yearning in my heart,<br />
this feverish burning's<br />
cruel smart,&mdash;<br />
did I but show it,<br />
couldst thou but know it,<br />
no time here wouldst thou tarry,<br />
to watch from tow'r thou wouldst hurry;<br />
with all devotion<br />
viewing the ocean,<br />
with eyes impatiently spying,<br />
there, where her ship's sails are flying.<br />
Before the wind she<br />
drives to find me;<br />
on the wings of love she neareth,&mdash;<br />
Isolda hither steereth!&mdash;<br />
she nears, she nears,<br />
so boldly and fast!<br />
It waves, it waves,<br />
the flag from the mast!<br />
Hurra! Hurra!<br />
she reaches the bar!<br />
Dost thou not see?<br />
Kurvenal, dost thou not see?</p>
<p>(<i>As</i> KURNEVAL <i>hesitates to leave</i> TRISTAN, <i>who is
gazing at him in mute expectation, the mournful tune of the
shepherd is heard, as before</i>.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>dejectedly</i>). Still is no ship in sight.</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>has listened with waning excitement and now
recommences with growing melancholy</i>).<br />
Is this the meaning then,<br />
thou old pathetic ditty,<br />
of all thy sighing sound?&mdash;<br />
On evening's breeze<br />
it sadly rang<br />
when, as a child,<br />
my father's death-news chill'd me;<br />
through morning's mist<br />
it stole more sadly,<br />
when the son<br />
his mother's fate was taught,<br />
when they who gave me breath<br />
both felt the hand of death<br />
to them came also<br />
through their pain<br />
the ancient ditty's<br />
yearning strain,<br />
which asked me once<br />
and asks me now<br />
which was the fate before me<br />
to which my mother bore me?&mdash;<br />
What was the fate?&mdash;<br />
The strain so plaintive<br />
now repeats it:&mdash;<br />
for yearning&mdash;and dying!</p>
<p>(<i>He falls back senseless</i>.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>who has been vainly striving to calm</i> TRISTAN,
<i>cries out in terror</i>).<br />
My master! Tristan!&mdash;<br />
Frightful enchantment!&mdash;<br />
O love's deceit!<br />
O passion's pow'r!<br />
Most sweet dream 'neath the sun,<br />
see the work thou hast done!&mdash;<br />
Here lies he now,<br />
the noblest of knights,<br />
with his passion all others above:<br />
behold! what reward<br />
his ardor requites;<br />
the one sure reward of love!</p>
<p>(<i>with sobbing voice</i>.)</p>
<p>Art thou then dead?<br />
Liv'st thou not?<br />
Hast to the curse succumbed?&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>He listens for</i> TRISTAN'S <i>breath</i>.)</p>
<p>O rapture! No!<br />
He still moves! He lives!<br />
and gently his lips are stirr'd.</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>very faintly</i>). The ship&mdash;is't yet in sight?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The ship? Be sure<br />
t'will come to-day:<br />
it cannot tarry longer.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. On board Isolda,&mdash;<br />
see, she smiles&mdash;<br />
with the cup<br />
that reconciles.<br />
Dost thou see?<br />
Dost thou see her now?<br />
Full of grace<br />
and loving mildness,<br />
floating o'er<br />
the ocean's wildness?<br />
By billows of flowers<br />
lightly lifted,<br />
gently toward<br />
the land she's drifted.<br />
Her look brings ease<br />
and sweet repose;<br />
her hand one last<br />
relief bestows.<br />
Isolda! Ah, Isolda!<br />
How fair, how sweet art thou!&mdash;<br />
And Kurvenal, why!&mdash;<br />
what ails thy sight?<br />
Away, and watch for her,<br />
foolish I see so well and plainly,<br />
let not thine eye seek vainly<br />
Dost thou not hear?<br />
Away, with speed!<br />
Haste to the watch-tow'r!<br />
Wilt thou not heed?<br />
The ship, the ship!<br />
Isolda's ship!&mdash;<br />
Thou must discern it,<br />
must perceive it!<br />
The ship&mdash;dost thou see it?&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Whilst</i> KURVENAL, <i>still hesitating, opposes</i>
TRISTAN, <i>the Shepherd's pipe is heard without, playing a joyous
strain</i>.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>springing joyously up</i>).<br />
O rapture! Transport!</p>
<p>(<i>He rushes to the watch-tower and looks out</i>.)</p>
<p>Ha! the ship!<br />
From northward it is nearing.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. So I knew,<br />
so I said!<br />
Yes, she yet lives,<br />

How could Isold'<br />
from this world be free,<br />
which only holds<br />
Isolda for me?</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>shouting</i>). Ahoy! Ahoy!<br />
See her bravely tacking!<br />
How full the canvas is filled!<br />
How she darts! how she flies!</p>
<p>TRISTAN. The pennon? the pennon?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. A flag is floating at mast-head,<br />
joyous and bright.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Aha! what joy!<br />
Now through the daylight<br />
comes my Isolda.<br />
Isolda, oh come!<br />
See'st thou herself?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The ship is shut<br />
from me by rocks.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Behind the reef?<br />
Is there not risk!<br />
Those dangerous breakers<br />
ships have oft shattered.&mdash;<br />
Who steereth the helm?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The steadiest seaman.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Betrays he me?<br />
Is he Melot's ally?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Trust him like me.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. A traitor thou, too!&mdash;<br />
O caitiff!<br />
Canst thou not see her?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Not yet.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Destruction!</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Aha! Halla-halloa I<br />
they clear! they clear!<br />
Safely they clear!<br />
Inside the surf<br />
steers now the ship to the strand.</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>shouting in joy</i>). Hallo-ho! Kurvenal!<br />
Trustiest friend!<br />
All the wealth I own<br />
to-day I bequeath thee.</p>
<p>KURVENAL. With speed they approach.</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Now dost thou see her?<br />
See'st thou Isolda?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. 'Tis she! she waves!</p>
<p>TRISTAN. O woman divine!</p>
<p>KURVENAL. The ship is a-land!<br />
Isolda.'&mdash;ha!&mdash;<br />
With but one leap<br />
lightly she springs to land!</p>
<p>TRISTAN. Descend from the watch-tow'r,<br />
indolent gazer!<br />
Away! away<br />
to the shore!<br />
Help her! help my belov'd!</p>
<p>KURVENAL. In a trice she shall come;<br />
Trust in my strong arm!<br />
But thou, Tristan,<br />
hold thee tranquilly here!</p>
<p>(<i>He hastens off</i>.)</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>tossing on his couch in feverish
excitement</i>).<br />
O sunlight glowing,<br />
glorious ray!<br />
Ah, joy-bestowing<br />
radiant day!<br />
Boundeth my blood,<br />
boisterous flood!<br />
Infinite gladness!<br />
Rapturous madness!<br />
Can I bear to lie<br />
couched here in quiet?<br />
Away, let me fly<br />
to where hearts run riot!<br />
Tristan the brave,<br />
exulting in strength,<br />
has torn himself<br />
from death at length.</p>
<p>(<i>He raises himself erect</i>.)</p>
<p>All wounded and bleeding<br />
Sir Morold I defeated;<br />
all bleeding and wounded<br />
Isolda now shall be greeted.</p>
<p>(<i>He tears the bandage from his wound</i>.)</p>
<p>Ha, ha, my blood!<br />
Merrily flows it.</p>
<p>(<i>He springs from his bed and staggers forward</i>.)</p>
<p>She who can help<br />
my wound and close it,<br />
she comes in her pride,<br />
she comes to my aid.<br />
Be space defied:<br />
let the universe fade!</p>
<p>(<i>He reels to the centre of the stage</i>.)</p>
<p>ISOLDA'S VOICE (<i>without</i>).<br />
Tristan! Tristan! Belov&eacute;d!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>in frantic excitement</i>).<br />
What! hails me the light?<br />
The torchlight&mdash;ha!&mdash;<br />
The torch is extinct!<br />
I come! I come!</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p>[ISOLDA <i>hastens breathlessly in</i>. TRISTAN, <i>delirious
with excitement, staggers wildly towards her. They meet in the
centre of the stage; she receives him in her arms, where he sinks
slowly to the ground</i>.]</p>
<p>ISOLDA. Tristan! Ah!</p>
<p>TRISTAN (<i>turning, his dying eyes on</i> ISOLDA).
Isolda!&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>He dies</i>.)</p>
<p>ISOLDA. 'Tis I, 'tis I&mdash;<br />
dearly belov'd!<br />
Wake, and once more<br />
hark to my voice!<br />
Isolda calls.<br />
Isolda comes,<br />
with Tristan true to perish.&mdash;<br />
Speak unto me!<br />
But for one moment,<br />
only one moment<br />
open thine eyes!<br />
Such weary days<br />
I waited and longed,<br />
that one single hour<br />
I with thee might awaken.<br />
Betrayed am I then?<br />
Deprived by Tristan<br />
of this our solitary,<br />
swiftly fleeting,<br />
final earthly joy?&mdash;<br />
His wound, though&mdash;where?<br />
Can I not heal it?<br />
The rapture of night<br />
O let us feel it?<br />
Not of thy wounds,<br />
not of thy wounds must thou expire!<br />
Together, at least,<br />
let fade life's enfeebled fire!&mdash;<br />
How lifeless his look!&mdash;<br />
still his heart!&mdash;<br />
Dared he to deal me<br />
Buch a smart?<br />
Stayed is his breathing's<br />
gentle tide!<br />
Must I be wailing<br />
at his side,<br />
who, in rapture coming to seek him,<br />
fearless sailed o'er the sea?<br />
Too late, too late!<br />
Desperate man!<br />
Casting on me<br />
this cruelest ban!<br />
Comes no relief<br />
for my load of grief?<br />
Silent art keeping<br />
while I am weeping?<br />
But once more, ah!<br />
But once again!&mdash;<br />
Tristan!&mdash;ha!<br />
he wakens&mdash;hark!<br />
Beloved&mdash;<br />
&mdash;dark!</p>
<p>(<i>She sinks down senseless upon his body</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p>[KURVENAL, <i>who re&euml;ntered close behind</i> ISOLDA, <i>has
remained by the entrance speechless and petrified, gazing
motionless on</i> TRISTAN. <i>From below is now heard the dull
murmur of voices and the clash of weapons. The Shepherd clambers
over the wall</i>.]</p>
<p>SHEPHERD (<i>coming hastily and softly to</i> KURVENAL).<br />
Kurvenal! Hear!<br />
Another ship!</p>
<p>(KURVENAL <i>starts up in haste and looks over the rampart,
whilst the Shepherd stands apart, gazing in consternation on</i>
TRISTAN <i>and</i> ISOLDA.)</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Fiends and furies!</p>
<p>(<i>In a burst of anger</i>.)</p>
<p>All are at hand!<br />
Melot and Mark<br />
I see on the strand,&mdash;<br />
Weapons and missiles!&mdash;<br />
Guard we the gate!</p>
<p>(<i>He hastens with the Shepherd to the gate, which they both
try quickly to barricade</i>.)</p>
<p>THE STEERSMAN (<i>rushing in</i>).<br />
Mark and his men<br />
have set on us:<br />
defence is vain!<br />
We're overpowered.</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Stand to and help!&mdash;<br />
While lasts my life<br />
I'll let no foe enter here!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA'S VOICE (<i>without, calling from
below</i>).<br />
Isolda! Mistress!</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Brang&aelig;na's voice! (<i>Falling down</i>.)<br />
What want you here?</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Open, Kurvenal!<br />
Where is Isolda?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. With foes do you come?<br />
Woe to you, false one!</p>
<p>MELOT'S VOICE (<i>without</i>). Stand back, thou fool!<br />
Bar not the way!</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>laughing savagely</i>). Hurrah for the day<br />
on which I confront thee!</p>
<p>(MELOT, <i>with armed men, appears under the gateway</i>.
KURVENAL <i>falls on him and cuts him down</i>.)</p>
<p>Die, damnable wretch!</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>MELOT. Woe's me!&mdash;Tristan! (<i>He dies</i>.)</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>still without</i>). Kurvenal! Madman!<br />
O hear&mdash;thou mistakest!</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Treacherous maid! (<i>To his men</i>.)<br />
Come! Follow me!<br />
Force them below! (<i>They fight</i>.)</p>
<p>MARK (<i>without</i>). Hold, thou frantic man!<br />
Lost are thy senses?</p>
<p>KURVENAL. Here ravages Death!<br />
Nought else, O king,<br />
is here to be holden!<br />
If you would earn it, come on!</p>
<p>(<i>He sets upon</i> MARK <i>and his followers</i>.)</p>
<p>MARK. Away, rash maniac!</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>has climbed over the wall at the side and
hastens in the front</i>).<br />
Isolda! lady!<br />
Joy and life!&mdash;<br />
What sight's here&mdash;ha!<br />
Liv'st thou, Isolda! (<i>She goes to</i> ISOLDA'S <i>aid</i>.)</p>
<p>MARK (<i>who with his followers has driven</i> KURVENAL <i>and
his men back from the gate and forced his way in</i>). O wild
mistake! Tristan, where art thou?</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>desperately wounded, totters before</i> MARK <i>to
the front</i>).<br />
He lieth&mdash;there&mdash;<br />
here, where I lie too.&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Sinks down at</i> TRISTAN'S <i>feet</i>.)</p>
<p>MARK. Tristan! Tristan!<br />
Isolda! Woe!</p>
<p>KURVENAL (<i>trying to grasp</i> TRISTAN'S <i>hand</i>).<br />
Tristan! true lord!<br />
Chide me not<br />
that I try to follow thee! (<i>He dies</i>.)</p>
<p>MARK. Dead together!&mdash;<br />
All are dead!<br />
My hero Tristan!<br />
truest of friends,<br />
must thou again<br />
be to thy king a traitor?<br />
Now, when he comes<br />
another proof of love to give thee!<br />
Awaken! awaken.<br />
O hear my lamentation,<br />
thou faithless, faithful friend!</p>
<p>(<i>Kneels down sobbing over the bodies</i>.)</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA (<i>who has revived</i> ISOLDA <i>in her
arms</i>).<br />
She wakes! she lives!<br />
Isolda, hear!<br />
Hear me, mistress beloved!<br />
Tidings of joy<br />
I have to tell thee:<br />
O list to thy Brang&aelig;na!<br />
My thoughtless fault I have atoned;<br />
after thy flight<br />
I forthwith went to the king:<br />
the love potion's secret<br />
he scarce had learned<br />
when with sedulous haste<br />
he put to sea,<br />
that he might find thee,<br />
nobly renounce thee<br />
and give thee up to thy love.</p>
<p>MARK. O why, Isolda,<br />
Why this to me?<br />
When clearly was disclosed<br />
what before I could fathom not,<br />
what joy was mine to find<br />
my friend was free from fault!<br />
In haste to wed<br />
thee to my hero<br />
with flying sails<br />
I followed thy track:<br />
but howe'er can<br />
happiness<br />
o'ertake the swift course of woe?<br />
More food for Death did I make:<br />
more wrong grew in mistake.</p>
<p>BRANG&AElig;NA. Dost thou not hear?<br />
Isolda! Lady!<br />
O try to believe the truth!</p>
<p>ISOLDA (<i>unconscious of all around her, turning her eyes with,
rising inspiration on</i> TRISTAN'S <i>body</i>).<br />
Mild and softly<br />
he is smiling;<br />
how his eyelids sweetly open!<br />
See, oh comrades,<br />
see you not<br />
how he beameth<br />
ever brighter&mdash;<br />
how he rises<br />
ever radiant<br />
steeped in starlight,<br />
borne above?<br />
See you not<br />
how his heart<br />
with lion zest,<br />
calmly happy<br />
beats in his breast?<br />
From his lips<br />
in heavenly rest<br />
sweetest breath<br />
he softly sends.<br />
Harken, friends!<br />
Hear and feel ye not?<br />
Is it I<br />
alone am hearing<br />
strains so tender<br />
and endearing?<br />
Passion swelling,<br />
all things telling,<br />
gently bounding,<br />
from him sounding,<br />
in me pushes,<br />
upward rushes<br />
trumpet tone<br />
that round me gushes.<br />
Brighter growing,<br />
o'er me flowing,<br />
are these breezes<br />
airy pillows?<br />
Are they balmy<br />
beauteous billows?<br />
How they rise<br />
and gleam and glisten!<br />
Shall I breathe them?<br />
Shall I listen?<br />
Shall I sip them,<br />
dive within them,<br />
to my panting<br />
breathing win them?<br />
In the breezes around,<br />
in the harmony sound<br />
in the world's driving<br />

and, sinking,<br />
be drinking&mdash;<br />
in a kiss,<br />
highest bliss!</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

opportunities to fix the problem.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
